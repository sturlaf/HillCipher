This is an implementation of the Hill cipher cryptography system.

OBS! This is only designed for academical purposes, not for actuall use! The code might contain security vulnerabilitys, and Hill cipher is in general not considered to be a secure crypto system. It is vulnerable to "known-plaintext" attacks.
